    "\n",
    "**Welcome to the Exercise!**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will implement a simplified version of a speculative decoding loop from scratch. This will give you a deep, hands-on understanding of how this powerful technique works to accelerate inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Goal:**\n",
    "1.  Implement a standard **autoregressive decoding** loop to serve as our performance baseline.\n",
    "2.  Implement a **speculative decoding** loop using a small \"draft\" model (`gpt2`) and a larger \"target\" model (`gpt2-medium`).\n",
    "3.  Run experiments by varying the number of draft tokens (`K`) to find the **optimal value** that balances speed and efficiency.\n",
    "4.  Analyze the results to understand the trade-offs between `K`, the number of target model calls, and overall wall-clock time."

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "### Sample Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Target Passes**: As `K` increased, the number of target model passes decreased significantly and consistently. The baseline required 60 passes, while `K=10` required only a fraction of that. This is because a larger `K` allows more tokens to be verified in a single batch, reducing the number of verification steps needed to generate the full sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Wall-Clock Time**: Time initially decreased as `K` went from 1 to 4, hitting an **optimal point around K=4 or K=5**. For `K` values larger than that, the total time began to increase again. This happens because while a large `K` reduces target passes, the draft model generates more tokens that are likely to be incorrect. The overhead of generating these useless draft tokens, combined with processing a larger verification batch in the target model, eventually outweighs the benefit of fewer verification steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Average Accepted Tokens**: The average number of tokens accepted per verification step consistently increased with `K`. This metric is a great measure of efficiency; a value greater than 1.0 means speculative decoding is outperforming the baseline (which accepts 1 token per pass). A higher number indicates the draft model's predictions are often correct, allowing us to accept multiple tokens for the cost of one target pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Trade-offs & Conclusion**:\n",
    "    *   **Small `K` (e.g., 1-2)**: Safe and low overhead. The draft tokens are more likely to be correct, but the potential speedup is limited because you aren't trying to accept many tokens at once.\n",
    "    *   **Large `K` (e.g., 8-10)**: High risk, high reward. It dramatically reduces target passes, but the draft model is more likely to make a mistake early on. The computational overhead of generating and verifying many draft tokens can negate the time savings.\n",
    "    *   **Optimal `K` (e.g., 4-5)**: This is the \"sweet spot.\" It's large enough to get a significant speedup by accepting multiple tokens per pass but small enough that the draft model remains accurate and the overhead doesn't become a bottleneck.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this `gpt2`/`gpt2-medium` pairing, a **`K` value of 4 or 5 is the optimal choice**, providing the best wall-clock time speedup."
