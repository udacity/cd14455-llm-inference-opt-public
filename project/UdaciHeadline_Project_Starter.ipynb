    "## Project Introduction\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming content creation, but deploying them efficiently remains a major hurdle. Imagine you're an ML Engineer at a bustling online news portal. Your key task? Automatically generating catchy headlines from article summaries using an LLM. The problem? The current inference process is sluggish, causing publication delays and driving up operational costs. In this project, UdaciHeadline, you'll step into this role and tackle this critical challenge head-on. Your mission is to accelerate the headline generation pipeline significantly by applying state-of-the-art LLM inference optimization techniques. Get ready to dive deep into practical optimization and deployment!"
